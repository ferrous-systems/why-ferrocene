# The downstream model

## Some examples

* Enterprise Linux Distributions are a downstream of The Linux Kernel
* The Linux Kernel makes kernel releases
* The Enterprise Linux Vendor then:
  * takes the source code,
  * runs their test suite,
  * adds any required fixes or backports,
  * publishes it as open source, and
  * sells their customers binaries with a long-term support package

Note:

They are a downstream of a whole bunch of open source packages - GCC, glibc, LibreOffice, bash, etc.

## It's the same model

* Ferrocene is a downstream of The Rust Project
* The Rust Project makes toolchain releases
* Ferrous Systems then:
  * takes the source code,
  * runs their test suite,
  * adds any required fixes or backports,
  * publishes it as open source, and
  * sells their customers binaries with a long-term support package

## Yes, Ferrocene is Open Source

We think it's the world's first open-source qualified toolchain

## Yes, there's Long Term Support

* You can buy support on a commercial basis
* More on this later
