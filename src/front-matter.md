## Introduction

In this introductory session titled _Why Ferrocene?_ you will learn what Ferrocene is
about, where it is from and where it is going, and whether it is right for you
to look at Ferrocene for your next security-related or safety-critical project.
The agenda includes a short lecture, a live programming demonstration, and a
Q&A session.

We conduct all training sessions remotely using modern video-conferencing tools
to ensure the best learning experience.
