# Why Ferrocene?

An introduction to the Ferrocene toolchain, what is is (and isn't) and what it
can do.

## Introduction

In our one hour session on _Why Ferrocene?_ you will learn what Ferrocene is
about, where it is from and where it is going, and whether it is right for you
to look at Ferrocene for your next security-related or safety-critical project.
The agenda includes a short lecture, a live programming demonstration, and a
Q&A session.

We conduct all training sessions remotely using modern video-conferencing tools
to ensure the best learning experience.
